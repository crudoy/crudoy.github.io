                    <h3>Litigation</h3>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                        <h3>Mediation</h3>
                        <p>Often times, real estate cases are not fought in court, but rather in mediation. In mediation, Milo &amp; Maverick strive to achieve productive communication and produce collaborative solutions. Working with a mediator allows clients the opportunity to negotiate their position in the hopes of getting a resolution that is equitable to both parties. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Sometimes, however, mediation can result in a stalemate, leaving litigation as an option for resolution. In this case, you can count on Milo &amp; Maverick to stand up for your position vigorously and with dignity and respect for both your position and the judicial process. </p>
