                            <p>Laura Maverick grew up in London, England but moved to the United States with her family in 1995.

                        <p>Attorney Joseph Mia is California born and raised, growing up in the beach community of Pacific Palisades. From childhood, he knew he wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and become an attorney. Joseph graduated law school from Southwestern University in 2014 and started his own real estate practice shortly after.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Joseph has frequently been called by other attorneys to be a home inspection expert witness, making him an asset to the Maverick &amp; Milo team. He is a guest lecturer at the Los Angeles Attorney Incubator Consortium (LAIC), seeking to provide mentorship and support to new attorneys.

                        <aside><small><em>Associate Attorney</em></small></aside>
                        <p>Kara Casper began her adult life as an early childhood teacher up in the Bay Area. Upon realizing a number of student's families were involved in legal battles with their homes, Kara had a desire to better understand California real estate law.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A few years later, Kara found her self applying to law school up and down the California coast. Graduating from Pepperdine in 2012, she made her stay in Southern California perminant. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After opening her law practice, Kara's interests narrowed further into neighbor disputes and landlord-tenant cases to help make family lives better in a more direct way. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In her spare time, Kara volunteers at her local YMCA and started an after school program to bring enrichment to kids when they're out of school. She has a dog named Chloe with whom she loves to take on roadtrips back home.

                        <p>As the son of a firefighter and librarian, Steve always knew he was destined for a life as a public servant, even if that wasn't his first choice. After graduating law school, Steve began his practice as part of the general counsel's office for a health insurance giant.
                            After a few years of that, Steve left that practice and joined Maverick & Milo as their purchasing contracts specialist.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Steve is also a seasoned mediator, helping opposing parties find a solution without having to incur court costs. He also volunteers at non-profits to extend his legal services to those who may not have access to quality representation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After hours, Steve enjoys spending time coaching his son's little league games and being his daughter's chauffer to the mall.</p>

                        <p>Though he'll always be a Bears fan, Reggie has made a home for himself in Los Angeles, CA. As a first generation American, Reggie found he had two choices for a career path, a doctor or an attorney. After working his way though Law School, Reggie found himself in Sacramento, clerking for a judge on the California Supreme Court.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After a few years, Reggie moved down to Los Angeles to join Maverick &amp; Milo and finally get the California weather he was always promised. 
                            As a real estate attorney, Reggie's passion is litigation. Reggie enjoys helping his clients stand up for their legal rights and being a voice for their concerns.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In his free time, Reggie can be found on the pickleball court with his husband, seeking out new restuarants, and back in Chicago (probably at a Bear's game).

                        <em>The Maverick &amp; Milo team are amazing. They listened and took notes on our first call after I signed the retainer. They then sent me an email after the call with a recap of what we talked about. I am so thankful to have attorneys who are engaged in my case and present in conversations with me. As a firm, they work collaboratively on their cases to ensure the best possible outcome. Though we're still in the middle of it all, I have full confidence in Kayla, Mia, and their team.</em>

                        <em>They are everything you'd want in your attorneys. At the beginning, Kayla and Steve told me that they didn't want me to act as an attorney, they just wanted me to be myself. Doing that, I believe, is what led to a quick resolution in my case. I didn't get everything I wanted, but at least I can live contently in my apartment complex again.</em>

                        <em>When you've experienced bad attorneys, it's hard to sometimes trust the good ones. Kara and Laura were so patient with me and gave me the space to let all my feelings out without judgement about my case. My case is pretty stressful for me, which affects my kids, so to have adults that I feel like I can talk to is a big weight off of my shoulders. Unfortunately, my case needed to be brought before a judge, but Reggie and Joseph have worked tirelessly to make sure that our arguments, our experts, and our questions for the opposing counsel are well thought out, communicated effectively, and credible. Like I said, we're still in the thick of it, but, between you and me, I'm pretty sure the judge likes my legal team better!</em>
